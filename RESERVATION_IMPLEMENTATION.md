# Item Reservation Interface Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive item reservation system with calendar view for the Brocy inventory management application. The implementation includes API routes, React components, and user interface pages that allow users to:

1. View item availability in a calendar format
2. Make reservations for specific date ranges
3. Manage existing reservations
4. Check for scheduling conflicts
5. Approve/reject reservations (admin functionality)

## Components Implemented

### 1. API Routes (`/api/reservations/`)

#### Main Reservations API (`route.ts`)
- **GET**: Fetch reservations with filtering, pagination, and role-based access
- **POST**: Create new reservations with validation and conflict detection
- Features:
  - Date range validation
  - Conflict detection with existing reservations
  - Role-based filtering (borrowers see only their reservations)
  - Comprehensive error handling

#### Individual Reservation Management (`[id]/route.ts`)
- **GET**: Fetch detailed reservation information
- **PATCH**: Update reservation status, dates, and metadata
- **DELETE**: Remove reservations with proper access control
- Features:
  - Status management (PENDING → APPROVED → ACTIVE → COMPLETED)
  - Rejection workflow with reason tracking
  - Role-based access control

#### Availability Check API (`availability/route.ts`)
- **GET**: Check item availability for specific dates or months
- Features:
  - Real-time conflict detection
  - Calendar data for month view
  - Reservation overlap calculation

### 2. React Components

#### ReservationForm (`reservation-form.tsx`)
- Interactive form for creating reservations
- Real-time availability checking
- Date validation (no past dates, end after start)
- Conflict display with existing reservations
- Features:
  - Automatic availability validation
  - Visual feedback for conflicts
  - Purpose and notes fields
  - Form validation with zod schema

#### ReservationCalendar (`reservation-calendar.tsx`)
- Full calendar interface showing item availability
- Visual indicators for different reservation states
- Interactive date selection for reservations
- Features:
  - Month navigation
  - Color-coded availability states
  - Click-to-select date ranges
  - Reservation details on click
  - Loading states and error handling

### 3. User Interface Pages

#### Main Reservations Page (`/reservations/page.tsx`)
- Integrated calendar and form interface
- Item details and status display
- Dynamic form showing based on date selection
- Features:
  - Calendar view integration
  - Form state management
  - Reservation creation workflow
  - Success/error feedback

#### Individual Reservation Management (`/reservations/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Detailed reservation view and management
- Admin approval/rejection workflow
- Status tracking and history
- Features:
  - Comprehensive reservation details
  - Role-based action buttons
  - Approval/rejection with reason
  - Item information display

## Key Features

### 1. Calendar Integration
- Visual representation of item availability
- Color-coded reservation states:
  - Green: Available
  - Yellow: Pending approval
  - Blue: Approved/Active
  - Gray: Unavailable
  - Red: Cancelled/Rejected

### 2. Conflict Detection
- Real-time availability checking
- Prevention of double-booking
- Clear conflict messaging
- Alternative date suggestions

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
- **Borrowers**: Create and view own reservations
- **Staff/Managers**: Approve, reject, and manage all reservations
- **Super Admins**: Full system access including deletion

### 4. Status Workflow
```
PENDING → APPROVED → ACTIVE → COMPLETED
    ↓         ↓
 REJECTED  CANCELLED
```

### 5. Data Validation
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Date range validation
- Business logic enforcement
- Error handling and user feedback

## Integration Points

### 1. Navigation Integration
- Added "Reservations" link to dashboard navigation
- Integrated "Reserve Item" button on item detail pages
- Breadcrumb navigation for user flow

### 2. Authentication Integration
- Session-based access control
- Role permission checking
- User context integration

### 3. Database Integration
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- Complex queries for conflict detection
- Transaction support for data consistency

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies Added
- `react-calendar`: Calendar component library
- `@types/react-calendar`: TypeScript definitions

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/reservations` - List reservations
- `POST /api/reservations` - Create reservation
- `GET /api/reservations/[id]` - Get reservation details
- `PATCH /api/reservations/[id]` - Update reservation
- `DELETE /api/reservations/[id]` - Delete reservation
- `GET /api/reservations/availability` - Check availability

### Database Schema Usage
- Utilizes existing Prisma schema for Reservations
- Leverages User and Item relationships
- Supports complex filtering and sorting

## User Experience

### 1. Reservation Creation Flow
1. User navigates to item detail page
2. Clicks "Reserve Item" button (if available)
3. Views calendar with availability
4. Selects desired dates
5. Fills out reservation form
6. Checks availability before submission
7. Submits reservation for approval

### 2. Admin Management Flow
1. Admin views pending reservations
2. Reviews reservation details
3. Approves or rejects with reason
4. Tracks reservation lifecycle
5. Manages conflicts and cancellations

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation at API level
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states and feedback
- Graceful failure recovery

## Testing Considerations
- API endpoint testing for all CRUD operations
- Form validation testing
- Calendar interaction testing
- Conflict detection validation
- Role-based access testing

## Future Enhancements
- Email notifications for reservation status changes
- Automated status transitions based on dates
- Bulk reservation management
- Recurring reservation patterns
- Mobile optimization improvements

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready reservation system that integrates seamlessly with the existing Brocy inventory management application.
