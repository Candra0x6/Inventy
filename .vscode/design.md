I am currently working on redesigning UI elements for a web application using Next.js. I want you to create a strong and consistent style incorporating animations with Framer Motion, ensuring there are two modes: light mode and dark mode. Additionally, every card should have a shadow effect, be XL rounded, and be fully responsive.

The task is to develop a visually appealing and functional user interface that enhances user experience. You will need to focus on maintaining consistency across all design elements while implementing animations that add interactivity and flair.

The goal is to produce a modern and sleek UI that works seamlessly in both light and dark modes, enhances usability through responsive design, and employs animations to create a dynamic feel, ultimately leading to increased user engagement and satisfaction.
