## 8. Example User Flows

**Borrower (Alice):**

1. Logs in via Supabase Auth (Google SSO).
2. Browses catalog, finds “Projector”.
3. Reserves for 2 days → request sent.
4. Manager approves → status = “On Loan”.
5. Alice picks up → scans QR code → loan confirmed.
6. Alice returns item → condition checked → reputation updated.
7. If late/damaged → system applies penalties.

**Manager:**

1. Logs in.
2. Views pending requests.
3. Approves/denies with comments.
4. Reviews reports (usage, late returns).

---

## 9. Success Metrics

* % of organizations actively using.
* Item utilization rate.
* Reduction in lost/damaged goods.
* Borrower satisfaction score.
* Sustainability metrics (reuse impact).

---

⚡ This PRD is now **aligned with Next.js + Supabase architecture**:

* Supabase handles **auth, database, storage, real-time updates**.
* Next.js provides **frontend, SSR/ISR, responsive UI**.
* Future-ready for **mobile app or blockchain integration**.

Do you want me to also **map out the database schema for Supabase** (tables: users, items, reservations, returns, reputation, etc.) so you can go straight to implementation?
