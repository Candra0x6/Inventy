  item: null, 
  loading: false 
})

const [returnDialog, setReturnDialog] = useState({

  item: null, 
  loading: false 
})

const [cancelDialog, setCancelDialog] = useState({
  isOpen: false, 
  item: null, 
  loading: false 
})
```

#### Action Flow:
1. **User clicks Extend/Return/Cancel button**
2. **Dialog opens** with item details and confirmation
3. **User reviews information** and confirms or cancels
4. **API call executes** with loading state
5. **Dialog closes** and dashboard refreshes on success

#### Dialog Features:

### üé® Dialog Types & Styling

#### **Extend Dialog** (Warning Style)
- **Color**: Amber/Orange theme
- **Message**: Emphasizes the extension of borrowing period
- **Details**: Current due date ‚Üí New due date (7 days extension)

#### **Return Dialog** (Success/Warning Style)
- **Color**: Green theme (normal) / Orange theme (overdue)
- **Message**: Different messaging for overdue vs normal returns

### üîí Safety Features

- **Clear action descriptions** so users know what they're doing
- **Loading states** prevent multiple submissions
- **Error persistence** keeps dialog open if action fails
- **Destructive action warnings** for irreversible operations

### üéØ **Cancel Dialog Specific Features:**

#### **Enhanced Warning System:**
- Clear messaging about permanent nature of cancellation
- Warning about potential impact on future reservations
- Destructive styling (red theme) to emphasize seriousness

#### **Smart Button Labels:**
- **Confirm button**: "Cancel Reservation" (clear action)
- **Cancel button**: "Keep Reservation" (positive alternative)

#### **Relevant Information Display:**
- **Reserved On**: When the reservation was made
- **Start Date**: When the borrowing period was set to begin
- **Item Name**: Clear identification of what's being canceled

The confirmation dialogs are now fully integrated into your dashboard and will show whenever users try to extend borrowing periods, return items, or cancel reservations, ensuring they can review their actions before committing to them.

## Usage Example

When a user clicks any action button:
1. A modal dialog appears with item details
2. User sees current status and proposed changes
3. User can cancel or confirm the action
4. Loading state shows during API processing
5. Dialog closes and data refreshes on success

This significantly improves the user experience by preventing accidental actions and providing clear feedback throughout the process, especially for destructive actions like canceling reservations.
